# What it is

This project was made by @podpah and @caileighsmith during our Multiverse apprenticeship. We have used React, Express, Sequelize and CSS mostly on it.

### Running it

- Run the server by opening a terminal in the project directory, then run ```npm run serv``` (Back-end).
- To run the React front-end, open a seperate terminal, in the project directory, and run ```npm start``` (Front-end).
