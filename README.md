# What it is

This project was made by @podpah and @caileighsmith during our Multiverse apprenticeship. We have used React, Express, Sequelize and CSS mostly on it.

### Running it

To run it locally, you run ```npm run serv``` (for the server) in one terminal and in another terminal you type ```npm start``` (for the front-end React)
